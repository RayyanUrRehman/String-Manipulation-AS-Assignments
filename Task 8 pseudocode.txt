Task 8: 
Given a string s, return a string
where all occurences of its first char have
been changed to '*', except do not change
the first char itself.
e.g., 'babble' yields 'ba*le' or 'alpha' outputs 'alph'
Assume that the string is length 1 or more.

PSEUDOCODE:

Declare S ← string
Declare S2 ← string
Declare S3 ← string
Declare char1 ← character
Declare c ← character
Declare i ← Integer

S ← ""
S2 ← ""
S3 ← ""
char1 ← ''
c ← ''
i ← 0

Input "Enter string to process: ", S
char1 ← Left(S, 1)
 S2 ← Mid(S, 2, Len(S))
        For i ← 1 To Len(S2)
            c ← Mid(S2, i, 1)
            If Asc(c) <> Asc(char1) Then
                S3 ← S3 + c
            Else
                S3 ← S3 + "*"
            End If
        Next

Output "String after process is: " + char1 + S3
End
