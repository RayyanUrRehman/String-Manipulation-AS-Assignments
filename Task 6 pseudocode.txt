Task 6: 
donuts:
INPUT an INT count of a number of donuts, OUTPUT a string
of the form 'Number of donuts: <count>', where <count> is the number
input. However, if the count is 10 or more, then use the word 'many'
instead of the actual count.
So donuts(5) outputs 'Number of donuts: 5'
and donuts(23) outputs 'Number of donuts: many'

PSEUDOCODE:

Declare count1 : Integer

count1 ← 0

Input "Enter number of donuts: ", count1
If count1 < 10 then
Output "Number of donuts: ", count1
ElseIf count1 >= 10 then
Output "Number of donuts: many" 
EndIf
End
