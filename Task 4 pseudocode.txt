Task 4:
Find the character that appears most number of times in an entered string and output it.


PSEUDOCODE:

Declare c, i, count, mostcount : Integer     
Declare char1, mostchar : Character
Declare str1 : String

c, i, count, mostcount ← 0
char1, mostchar ← ' '
str1 ← " "

Input "Enter string to process: ", str1

For c ← 1 To Len(str1)
            char1 ← Mid(str1, c, 1)
            For i ← 1 To Len(str1)
                If Mid(str1, i, 1) ← char1 Then
                    count ← count + 1
                End If
            Next
            If count >= mostcount Then
                mostcount ← count
                mostchar ← char1
            End If
            count ← 0
        Next 

Output "Most repeated character is: " + mostchar + "repetition count: " + mostcount

End
