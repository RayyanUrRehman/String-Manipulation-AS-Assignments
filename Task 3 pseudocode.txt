Task 3: Count and output the number of an entered character in a string. Also output seperate counts for alphabets (case neutral), digits, and other characters in same entered string.

PSEUDOCODE:

Declare str1 : string
Declare char1, c : character
Declare totalalphas, totaldigits, totalchar1, totalspchar, i : integer

Str1 ← ""
char1 ← ''
c ← ''
totalalphas, totaldigits, totalchar1, totalspchar, i ← 0

Input "Enter string to process: ", str1
Input "Enter character to count: ", char1
str1 ← LCASE(str1)

For i ← 1 to Len(str1)
    c = Mid(str1, i, 1)
    If Asc(c) = Asc(char1) then
      totalchar1 ← totalchar1 + 1
      totalalphas ← totalalphas + 1
    Elseif Asc(c) >= 97 AND ASC(c) <= 122 then
      total alphas ← total alphas + 1
    Elseif Asc(c) >= 48 AND ASC(c) <= 57 then
      totaldigits ← totaldigits + 1
    Else totalspchar ← totalspchar + 1
    Endif
Next

Output char1 + " has been written " + totalchar1 + " times in the string." 
Output "Total number of alphabets entered are: " + totalalphas
Output "Total number of digits entered are: " + totaldigits
Output "Total number of special characters entered (including space) are: " + totalspchar

End
